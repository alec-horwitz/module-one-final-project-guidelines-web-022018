DESCRIPTION
---------------------
BarTender! The latest and greatest new bartending app! A fully immersive experience! WHOA

Will emulate a social interaction with a bartender, because who wants to socialize in real life?

In this app, you will be able to:
  1. View a drink menu!
  2. Open a tab and order some drinks! Don't see your favorite drink on the menu? Don't worry! You can tell your bartender how to make it! You can even ask for them to surprise you with a random drink from the menu!
  3. View your tab!
  4. Close your tab!
  5. Leave the simulation!

Please be aware that each bartender is an autonomous individual and if you teach one a new drink, that does not mean another knows how to make it. Keep in mind that that bar is crowded and you will not always get the same bartender for each order.

If you would like the bartender to surprise you, please say the secret password "surprise me".
